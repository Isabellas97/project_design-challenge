            <p>
              Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
              could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I
              wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had
              only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for
              some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I
              thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a
              daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was
              that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
              problem.

              As designers, we are often afraid of showing work thatâ€™s not
              finished or doesnâ€™t look perfect. You will learn to accept
              feedback and learn from it.
